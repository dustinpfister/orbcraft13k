This is a project for the 2014 js13kgames competition that can be found at http://js13kgames.com/

I had one month to make a game within a 13kb size limit, sadly I started the project late, and some things came up, so the game is no ware near what I was envisioning. Still I had allot of fun making it, and hope to continue developing it long after the competition ends.

Development Folder:
All unminified source code relevant to the project can be found here. I started out making this game under the name "geo defence" the source of which can be found in the development folder, along with the folders that make the latest versions of what I now call "orbCraft 13k".

mini folder:

pkg: folder:
stand alone zip files containing minified source.



HOW TO PLAY:

This is OrbCraft 13k, an idea for a game that I have been thinking about for a long time but have never 
got around to developing it. It is inspired by the gemcraft series of games by game in a bottle, to which 
I have lost more hours of my life then I would like to mention. I know you want a short description but this game 
is a bit complex, I will still try my best to make this brief.


* Use the mouse to make an Orb of type Fire, Earth, Water, or Air.
* The Orb will apear in your inventory, click and drag it to a building in the game board.
* The building can now defend itself from enemy's.
* Making Orbs cost Mana.
* You make more Mana over time, you also gain it from enemy's
* You can combine Orbs to make them more powerful, and to have interesting properties.
* When you kill all the enemy's, a new Level will start in which the enemy's will become more difficult.
* Good luck


Orbs and Attributes:

Orbs come in the following types, and have the corresponding attribute bonuses

* Fire - bonus to attack
* Earth - bonus to range
* Water - bonus to health
* Air - bonus to speed

* attack - The amount of damage that will be done to an enemy when an Orb attacks
* range  - The range in which an Orb can attack an enemy.
* health - Increases the max HP of the building in which the Orb is socketed, as well as the auto-heal rate.
* speed  - The rate at which an Orb attacks, and auto-heals per second.

All Orbs have the given attributes, however as stated above, certain orbs have bonuses to certain attributes. 
You can also make composite orbs with bonuses in more then one attribute depending on it's composition.
